# shared-folder-3d

live -> [https://nonplace.site/shared-folder]

### A simple folder interface that resembles macOS file system, but not as "flat".
In the original version, users can create their new folder, remame it and move it around; the new folder with all its changes will be updated in the database; the changes will also be shared with other online users as a live update. 
The current version disabled the database-writing function, which means users' manipulation to the folders will not be stored and updated anymore, because the db package is outdated.
